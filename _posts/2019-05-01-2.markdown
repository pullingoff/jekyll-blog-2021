**I've FINALLY got my own Github page!**

Today is May 1st 2019, the day I'm flying out to Seoul. It's been a year since I left there on April 27th, 2018!
One of my goal this May is creating my own Github page, learning how to use git, being familiar with HTML, CSS, and markdown.
So, I'm posting this blog at Toronto Pearson Airport that always brings up the memory of the first day in Canada.

<br>
I just wanna share some songs that I can't love more and the feelings I go through whenever I listen to the tracks.


<br>
One is **Lee Sora - Track 9**. This comforting song is what I listened to at the plane to Toronto. I embedded the youtube video playing with a river view of Seoul I can't wait to see it.

Another song is **Safeplanet - คำตอบ**, the song I'm gonna listen to in the air heading to Seoul. I've known this band only for 3 weeks, but I'm sure I'll stan them for a long time cuz this band let me know the coolness of Thai indie band. It's a shame I can't understand Thai tho.

Anyway, I hope you all have the greatest Summer and like my new Github page and these bops.

See you in Korea!
